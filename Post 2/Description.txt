# 📚 Day 2 – HTML Tags, Elements & Attributes

Today I learned three important concepts in HTML:

## 🔹 1. Tags
Tags tell the browser what type of content is being displayed.  
Examples: `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc.

Tags usually come in pairs:

<p>This is a paragraph</p> ```
🔹 2. Elements

An element includes:

opening tag

content

closing tag

Example:

<h1>Welcome to Day 2</h1>


This entire line is an HTML element.

🔹 3. Attributes

Attributes give extra information to a tag.
They are written inside the opening tag.

Example:

<img src="image.png" alt="Example Image">

✔ Summary:

Tags = instruction

Elements = structure

Attributes = additional details

I also practiced using <img> and <a> tags with attributes.
