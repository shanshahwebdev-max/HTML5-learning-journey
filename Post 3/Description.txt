Day 3 – HTML Headings, Lists & Line Breaks

Today I learned how to structure content inside a webpage using three important HTML features:

1. HTML Headings (h1–h6)
   Headings are used to show the importance of text.
   - <h1> is the largest and most important heading
   - <h6> is the smallest heading

2. HTML Lists
   Lists help display information clearly.
   - Ordered List (<ol>) shows items with numbers
   - Unordered List (<ul>) shows items with bullets

3. Line Break (<br>)
   The <br> tag is used to break the line without creating a new paragraph.

These concepts help make webpages clean, readable, and well-structured.
Learning them is an important step in building real websites.
